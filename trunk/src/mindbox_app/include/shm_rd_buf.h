 * @brief This file implements the shared memory data input system.
 *        The shared memory is meant to be shared between at least two processes and
 *        takes the form of a circular buffer with several pages. When one page is done
 *        writing a semaphore is set to inform the reader (this process) 
 *        that a page is available to read. only when the reader confirms that 
 *        the data has been read is the writer allowed to write in it.
 * 
 *        When no page is available to write, the current process drops the sample. The number
 *        of pages should be kept as small as possible to prevent processing old data while
 *        dropping newest...
